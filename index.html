				<h1>Hello, I'm Nafis</h1>
				<img src="images/profile-picture.png" alt="Nafis Abul Hassan" class="img-circle">
				<p>
					My name is Nafis Abul Hassan, I am 18 years old and I am currently completing my first year of studies at IESEG School of Management in La Défense. I live in Serris, near Disneyland Paris. I love architecture, cars and I'm fond of playing video games. I made this web page thanks to Le Wagon.

				<h2>Architecture</h2>
				<p>
					I like architecture and urbanism. I am particularly interested in the way cities work and deal with issues such as congestion or basic needs of people, like electricity or access to public transit. I also love the way modern buildings look and I have always been fascinated by the monumental style of skyscrapers, like in La Défense. I find them so impressive !

				<h2>Cars</h2>
				<p>
					I love cars, mostly German and Japanese ones. I can't wait to get my license and drive all day long ! I love both luxury sedans and more powerful and sportive cars. We talk all day long about cars with my friends, and we always send to each other publications showing races or pictures of beautiful cars. My favorite cars is the Nissan GTR R34.

				<h2>Video games</h2>
				<p>
					After a long day at school, there is only one thing that helps me relax at home : playing video games ! I love many types of games, like driving games, which is pretty obvious now that you know my love for cars. I also love games with a long and interesting story mode. Indeed, I believe thata good solo game is much better than an online one.
